             Im Christian Simpson I love Travelling and video games. My goal is once I graduate to go on a road trip to new york, I think it would be really interesting to see everything in one of the most popular cities in the world.
             I have also been offered a job after I graduate at BMO or Bank of Montreal as a mainframe analyst which is great news!
